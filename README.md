# Ullman-Foundations-of-CS

I came across Jeff Ullman's page and happened to find this interesting book - Foundations of CS, available in pdf chapterwise.
So, my immediate thought was to write an automated script that downloads and saves the pdfs in the local directory of my system, with filename as the chapter no.

# Requirements
